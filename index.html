                Hello world, my name is Luis Vela, I was born and raised in san Antonio, Texas. I attended Fox Tech high school, where I graduated with honors and ranked in the top ten of my class. Right out of high school, I attended san Antonio college, where I completed my basic which I later used to transfer to a two-year technical college. Growing up I was always getting in trouble for taking thing apart to see how they worked, Electronics where always on my list of favorites to disassemble. I was always fascinated by electronics so naturally a degree in this area made sense. After I made my decision on what to study, I decided to attended Hallmark College where I received my Associates degree in electrical engineering. Coming out of school, I landed a job with a company that specialized in designing and building custom control panels for industrial applications.
              
            </p>
          After spending 15 years of my life as a electrical control panel builder, I decided it was time for a change. Don’t get me wrong, I accomplished a lot and I am proud to be able to say that my work is out of this world, literally out of this world, but I felt that my time was up and I decided to pursue a career in web developing. With this bootcamp I will have the tools to expand my knowledge and have the ability to land a job as a full stack web developer. I’m excited to see what the future holds for me, but until then, let the games begin.</p>
